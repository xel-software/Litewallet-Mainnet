FIRST PREPARATION (ONLY DONE ONCE)
==================================

1. Install Windows
2. Install JAva JDK 1.8 from Sun and make sure that JDK bin/ directory is in PATH (usually it is not)
3. Install Git for Windows
4. Install TortoiseGIT
5. Install Cygwin with at least "zip", "unzip", "dos2unix" and the "python2" and "python2-pip" packages. All selectable in the cygwin setup, if you cant find them make sure to set the View from "Pending" to "Not Installed"!
6. Get a cup of coffee and enjoy your 5 minute break
7. Checkout the Litewallet
8. Create a folder called "jre-win" in the Litewallet-Mainnet/ root folder. Also create a "jre-mac" folder which will remain empty.
9. Download 64bit JRE 1.8 from Sun in .tar.gz format (for Windows: jre-8u131-windows-x64.tar.gz) and unzip the content of jre1.8.0_181\ into the jre-win/ folder you just created. In a way that you

DO NOT HAVE:
jre-win\jre1.8.0_181\bin or jre-win\jre1.8.0_181\lib
BUT INSTEAD YOU HAVE
jre-win\bin\ or jre-win\lib\

REPEATED STEP FOR EVERY NEW VERSION
